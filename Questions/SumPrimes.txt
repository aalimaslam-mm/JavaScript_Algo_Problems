A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. 

For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. 
In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

create a function that returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num (parameter).

for example 

sumPrimes(10) should return 17. {2,3,5,7} is the prime numbers that are less than 10 and the sum of it is 17.
